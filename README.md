# TwitterMonitorV2
DM me on Discord rtuna#4321 if you need any help.

## Before running:
1. Make sure you have Python installed
2. download & unzip this folder, and cd to here
3. run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Setup everything in `credentials.json`
5. Edit in the code:
  -- Discord webhooks for Unfiltered and Filtered channels
  -- User IDs that you want to monitor (you can use `http://gettwitterid.com/` to get users twitterID)


If you don't know what to put in into `credentials.json` watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2o_qt9cXicM) and follow the steps to get your keys and tokens.
You do not need to create a new Twitter account if you already have one.
